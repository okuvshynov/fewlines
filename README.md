# fewlines

Whether we like it or not, we debug things by putting print statements around.

`fewlines` is a supplement for this, allowing to plot charts which only take few lines in a terminal output, but can be a very useful piece of information.

Example use-case could be plotting distribution of weights, gradients and activations for layers in NN.

TODO: insert screenshots here.

While created originally to plot distributions of weights/gradients it can be also used to visualize time series and
is not restricted to ML use cases, obviously. Can be used to show latency distribution, for example.

Installation:
```
pip install fewlines
```
